LOCAL STORAGE
The main features of localStorage are:

1. Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
2. The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.

Methods:
1. setItem(key, value) – store key/value pair.
2. getItem(key) – get the value by key.
3. removeItem(key) – remove the key with its value.
4. clear() – delete everything.
5. key(index) – get the key on a given position.
6. length – the number of stored items.

Example:
localStorage.setItem('test', 1);
alert( localStorage.getItem('test') );

SESSION STORAGE
The sessionStorage object is used much less often than localStorage.
1. The sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab.
	* Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
	* But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the 
	  same origin).
2. The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.

Properties:
1. key – the key that was changed (null if .clear() is called).
2. oldValue – the old value (null if the key is newly added).
3. newValue – the new value (null if the key is removed).
4. url – the url of the document where the update happened.
5. storageArea – either localStorage or sessionStorage object where the update happened.
